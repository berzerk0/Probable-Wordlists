# Probable Wordlists
Wordlists sorted by populatirty originally created for password generation and testing

### Why slog through an encylopedic, alphabetized wordlist when you can start with the words people are most likely to use?

There are some great wordlists out there, but I decided to amalgamate, edit, trim and create a few of my own.

I couldn't find many lists that weren't sorted alphabetically - it seems like a dictionary attack should reflect actual human behavior as opposed to the alphabet.

I did not steal, phish, deceive or hack in any way to get hold of these passwords. 
All lines in these files were obtained through freely available means.


## Real-Passwords
These are **REAL** passwords. Every once in a while, a popular site has a high-profile security leak and passwords are released freely across the internet.
Some of these passwords can be found on aggregator sites where they are separated from usernames to protect the unfortunate victim.

The files in this folder come from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists, https://weakpass.com/ and https://hashes.org/
I've taken nearly all of the real passwords from these sites, combined them into a single list, removed duplicates and sorted by popularity. 

*NOTE THAT FOR THIS FIRST VERSION, ALL NON-ASCII CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED*

A more inclusive, and thus, more accurate list is in the works.

Lists sorted by popularity will include "probable" in the filename


## Dictionary-Style Lists

Wordlists including dictionaries, encyclopedic lists and miscellaneous.
