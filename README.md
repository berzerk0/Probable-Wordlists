### Check out the [Password Trend Analysis](https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists/blob/master/Trend-Analysis.md) - and learn!
I visualized the trends of passwords that appeared 10 times or more in analysis.
The charts contain _immediately actionable_ advice on how to make your passwords more unique.

# Probable Wordlists
Wordlists sorted by popularity originally created for password generation and testing

### Why slog through an encyclopedic, alphabetized wordlist when you can start with the words people are most likely to use?
#### Methodology - The Why and How

  While I was able to locate a few Password Wordlists that were sorted by popularity, the vast majority of lists, especially the larger lists, were sorted alphabetically. This seems like a major practicality flaw! If we assume that the most common password is _password_, (which is actually the 2nd most common, after _123456_) and we are performing a dictionary attack using an English dictionary, we are going to have to slog from _aardvark_ through _passover_ to get to _password_. I don't know off the top of my head just how common "aardvark" is as a password - but we could be wasting a lot of time by not starting with the most common password on our list!

  I went to SecLists, Weakpass, and Hashes.org and downloaded nearly every single Wordlist containing real passwords I could find. These lists were huge, and I ended up with over 80 GB actual, human-generated and used passwords. These were split up among over 350 files of varying length, sorting scheme, character encoding, origin and other properties. I sorted these files, removed duplicates from within the files themselves, and prepared to join them all together.

  Some of these lists were composed of the other lists, and some were exact duplicates. I took care to remove any exact duplicate files - we didn't need to have any avoidable false positives. __*If a password was found across multiple files, I considered this to be an approximation of its popularity.*__ If an entry was found in 5 files, it wasn't too popular. If an entry could be found in 300 files, it was very popular. Using Unix commands, I concatenated all the files into one giant file representing keys to over 4 billion secret areas on the web, and sorted them by number of appearances in the single file. From this, I was able to create a large wordlist sorted by popularity, not the alphabet.

## Real-Passwords
These are **REAL** passwords. 
Every once in a while, a popular site has a high-profile security leak and passwords are released freely across the internet.
Some of these passwords can be found on aggregator sites where they are separated from usernames to protect the unfortunate victim.

The files in this folder come from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists, https://weakpass.com/ and https://hashes.org/

*NOTE THAT UNTIL REV 2.0, ALL NON-ASCII CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED*
 * A more inclusive, and thus, more accurate list is in the works.

*NOTE THAT THE DUE TO THE NEWLINE DUPLICATES ISSUE, 'WPA-Length' LISTS MAY INCLUDE LINES OF 7 CHARACTERS*
 * This will be fixed in Rev 2.0


Lists sorted by popularity will include "probable" in the filename


## Dictionary-Style Lists

Wordlists including dictionaries, encyclopedic lists and miscellaneous.


## Tasklist and Plans

### Rev 2.0 Plan - Expected Mid-July 2017
* [ ] Include truly accurate WPA-Length sorting
* [x] More sources (This is what is taking the most time)
* [x] Bigger sources
* [ ] Non-ASCII Sources
* [ ] Specialized lists compiled from sources themselves
* [ ] Totally Recompile wordlists for improved accuracy, no duplicates from the get-go.
* [ ] Include Counts for some files

### Undetermined Future Plans
* [x] Come up with poetic name for 'things that'd be cool that I'm not sure when I'll do'
* [ ] Create list of "pure" common passwords for use with rule-based cracking
