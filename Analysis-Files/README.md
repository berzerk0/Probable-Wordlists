# Analysis Files



The files reached through this directory will assist in password analysis and recovery.<br>

__Most files can only be accessed [via torrent or MegaLink](Downloads.md).__ <br>
A few files are included in the repository, however.

All rules and masks were generated using the [PACK](https://github.com/iphelix/pack) project.



## Rules

HashCat rulesets allow for automatic modification of wordlist items during use of the HashCat software. These modifications can include changes in capitalization, the addition of characters, manipulation of a whole string and more.


Use of a ruleset takes `password` as an input and generates outputs like `PASSWORD`, `p455w0rd`, `dr0wssap`, etc.


*A mutation will be generated for __every__ rule in a ruleset.* Consider a ruleset with 5 entries and a wordlist with 20 lines. When combined, the functional size of the wordlist is increased from 20 to 100. Keep in mind that the smallest ruleset provided here is *26* entries long.

The use of rulesets increases the functional size of a wordlist, but may quickly result in far too many entries for practical use.

In order to limit this, I've divided the rules generated from `Top29Million-probable-v2.txt` into smaller, __cumulative__ files. These rules are sorted by probability, with the most common rules at the top of the list.

At 2.2GB, the largest ruleset should be used with only the shortest wordlists.<br>
Its use is not practical for any other purpose.


## Masks

__Masks are not included the repository and must be downloaded via torrent or MegaLink.__

HashCat uses character descriptions to outline password composition. They are similar to regular expressions.

* `?l` represents any character  `abdcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
* `?u` represents `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
* `?d` represnts `0123456789`

These are not the only characters available, merely an example.
These are used repeatedly to create __"Masks"__ that are used to describe combinations of characters.

* `?l?l?l?d?d?d` represents all combinations of lowercase letters and numbers from `aaa000` through `zzz999`.

* `?u?d?u?d?u?d` represents all combinations of capital letters and numbers from `A0A0A0` through `Z9Z9Z9`

* `?u?l?l?l?l` represents all 5-letter combinations with a capital first letter, from `Aaaaa` through `Zzzzz`



These masks are used to describe composition patterns in the list.
Two files are included:

* `ProbWL-mask-probable-v2.mask` contains all masks found in `Top2Billion-probable-v2.txt`, sorted by popularity
* `ProbWL-mask-probable-v2-counts.txt` contains the same contents as the first file, but each entry is paired with the number of times a password matching that mask appeared in the wordlist.
