# Real Passwords


##  These Are The Passwords!  

The files in this folder were generated by carving out __cumulative__ sections of concatenated source file. Passwords that appeared more than a certain number of times.


Files are available for passwords that appeared at least __350__, __250__, __150__, __75__, __50__, __25__, __15__, __10__, and __5__ times.

Lists sorted by popularity will include `probable-v2` in the filename.

__Note that these files are CUMULATIVE.__ <br>

I.E, the entirety of the smallest file is contained in the 2nd smallest file. All of the smaller files are contained in the largest file.  <br>

However, each unique line appears only once in each file.

Understand that a __LOWER__ appearance threshold results in a __LARGER__ file size, as the bar for acceptance into the file has been lowered.
